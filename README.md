# Landing-Page
This is my personal portfolio website where I will thoroughly structure and design this webpage using HTML & CSS with JavaScript to enhance the site. I decided to keep most parts of the project the same minus the font-sizing issues I had
throughout my project. I was recommended by the professor to consider changing the font itself but I really like the font so I am keeping it :). However, I did add icons instead of text where needed (in my project cards) to give my site a better visual flow instead of
text everywhere (in some places I combined them). I also made my form functional through netlify to send me emails to my contact.
